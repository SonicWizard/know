  There are a couple of ways to get cujoJS.
  cujoJS is designed to work collectively, or as individual parts.
  Use as much, or as little, of cujoJS as you need.

  If you're starting a new greenfield application, the fastest way to get going is with [cujoJS seed](#seed).
  seed provides the core cujoJS libraries in a preconfigured application shell.
  You just need to add your own business logic.

  If you have an existing application, or want to add another library that isn't included in seed, you can add it [a la carte](#alacarte).

  Most cujoJS libraries are designed to work equally well in both client and server environments.

  The most recent release of each cujoJS library is available here.
  You can either download an zip/tar archive of the release manually, or use a dependency management tool.
  [npm](https://npmjs.org/) is recommended for [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) deployments.
  [bower](http://bower.io/) is recommended for browser deployments.
  Of course, you can always grab a zip or tarball and manage the dependencies yourself.
