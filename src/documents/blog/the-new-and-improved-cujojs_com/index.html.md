# The new and improved cujojs.com!

cujoJS is taking off!  We've always felt that there was a need for better
architectural tools in JavaScript.  Obviously, we are not alone.  It seems
like we make new friends every day: developers from all over the JavaScript
community continually reach out to thank us for bringing sanity to their code
-- and their life.

These same folks pummel us for our lack of a real web presence as well
as our scant educational materials.  We're happy to announce we're beefing up!

## cujojs.com

We migrated [cujojs.com](http://cujojs.com) from a vanilla github-pages site
to a _real web app_.  Notice I didn't way web _page_.  Yes, it is an actual
_application_ with unit tests and everything.  Can that _other framework_ claim
the same?  "Tests? How do I write tests for this?"

Kudos to [Brian Cavalier](https://github.com/briancavalier/) who single-handedly
wrote the JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and tests for the pages.  Of course, Brian
says it was all a _piece of cake_ since he used [cujoJS/seed](http://github.com/cujoJS/seed).
There's lots to learn from the [source code](https://github.com/cujojs/cujojs.github.com).

Kudos also to [Craig Walls](https://github.com/habuma) who contributed the
Contacts sample app on the home page.  Craig is a strong Spring/Java engineer,
but he was able to create his first cujoJS app in short order using
[cujoJS/seed](http://github.com/cujoJS/seed).

Aside from the fresh new look of [cujojs.com](http://cujojs.com), our _inner
engineers_ are also quite proud of its underlying architecture.  We'll do a
follow-up post describing why [cujojs.com](http://cujojs.com) -- *the app* --
is so awesome.

Read the [cujoJS manifesto](http://cujojs.com/manifesto.html) to see what
motivates us.  If you feel similarly, consider joining us!

## Know cujoJS

If you're reading this on the web, you're already witnessing the new *cujoJS
developer center*, [know.cujojs.com](http://know.cujojs.com).  This is _the_
place to go to know more about cujoJS and it's underlying concepts and
technologies.  There are links to downloads, documentation, and sample apps,
and we're adding illuminating tutorials and timely blog posts all the time.

We recently received unprompted praise from an experienced technical trainer
who declared that the tutorials about JavaScript modules are *the best
on the web*!

Know cujoJS exists thanks to the diligent efforts of [Scott Andrews](https://github.com/scothis)
who created the entire site using [DocPad](http://docpad.org) and even wrote
many of the initial tutorials.

## How are we doing?

We would absolutely love your feedback on both [cujojs.com](http://cujojs.com)
and [know.cujojs.com](http://know.cujojs.com)!  Please open a github issue
with problems or praise [here (cujojs.com)](https://github.com/cujojs/cujojs.github.com/issues/new?labels=site-feedback)
